# opimage

Library for analysis

## Installing
  This lib is in development and should be considered 'ropey'. The install procedure is best done in a new Python Virtual Environment. [http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).
  
  Once you have a new virtualenv running, download and unzip the package and install with `python setup.py develop`
